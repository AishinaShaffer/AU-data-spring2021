# Assignment 2
## KEY TOPIC: Where and why has the metro declined, and what disadvantages will this cause this moving forward in the future?
### INTRODUCTION:
Thanks to emergency funding, WMATA will be avoiding the cataclysmic service cuts that would have canceled weekend rail service, cut bus routes and made it harder for commuters to get to their destinations in 2021. The funding infusion is a temporary reprieve from the impacts COVID-19 has had on ridership, long-term construction, and the WMATA budget, but we wondered what the long-term impacts COVID-19 will have on the transportation system thousands of people rely on every day. 

Our project aims to determine who was impacted most by COVID-related closures and service cuts, and who might stand to lose from future cuts or service changes as WMATA works to approve its FY2021 budget.
