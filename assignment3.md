I read an article from my hometown newspaper on [classrooms reopening to 5 days-per-week in Kanawha County, WV](https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/education/kanawha-classrooms-reopening-5-days-a-week-monday/article_5bf365e9-8cea-5802-8d36-76394f177b5a.html) following an order from the West Virginia Board of Education.

Three weeks ago (as of Feb. 5), the Kanawha County Board of Education expressed hesitancy in reopening schools for in-person instruction. Board members all voted to keep classrooms closed, but conceded that they would re-open if the state BOE ordered them to.

I'm interested in how parents in Kanawha County feel about schools opening up, and whether or not their child will continue virtual learning or swtich to in-person. I think this information would be beneficial to state officials when considering what moves are best for the overall wellbeing of West Virginians.

Here's what I'm looking for:
- Location, based on the nine main cities in Kanawha County (could lead to trends based on population density of each city)
- Number of students in household (how many students are effected)
- Grade Level(s) (general age of students)
