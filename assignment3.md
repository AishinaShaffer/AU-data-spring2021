I read an article from my hometown newspaper on [classrooms reopening to 5 days-per-week in Kanawha County, WV](https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/education/kanawha-classrooms-reopening-5-days-a-week-monday/article_5bf365e9-8cea-5802-8d36-76394f177b5a.html) following an order from the West Virginia Board of Education.

Three weeks ago (as of Feb. 5), the Kanawha County Board of Education expressed hesitancy in reopening schools for in-person instruction. Board members all voted to keep classrooms closed, but conceded that they would re-open if the state BOE ordered them to.

I'm interested in how parents in Kanawha County feel about schools opening up, and whether or not their child will continue virtual learning or swtich to in-person. I think this information would be beneficial judging how state officials are making decisions based on the feedback of their constituents.

Data would be collected through a parent survey. Here's what I'm looking for:
- Student age (identifying trends in age groups)
- Location, based on the nine main cities in Kanawha County (could lead to trends based on population density of each city)
  - Charleston
  - Dunbar
  - Marmet
  - Montgomery
  - Nitro
  - Smithers
  - South Charleston
  - St. Albans
- School (comparing data between schools across the county)
- Race (identifying trends in racial groups)
- Preferred learning option (choose between in-person, virtual and hybrid)
- Concerns (user submitted info)

| Student Age | City | School | Race | Preferred Learning Option | Reasoning |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 9 | Charleston | Ruffner Elementary School | Mixed | Virtual | Minimizing exposure |
| 17 | Charleston | Capital High School | Mixed | In-Person | Student enrolled in program that is only in-person |
| 15 | Charleston | George Washington High School | White | In-person | Virtual learning environment unsuitable for student's learning style |
| 12 | South Charleston | South Charleston High School | Black | Virtual | Student is immunocompromised |
| 5 | Dunbar | Dunbar Primary School | White | Hybrid | Concerned about minimizing exposure, but also student's development of social skills |
