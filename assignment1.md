[‘Making a living off of selling death’: From dealers to addicts, opioid crisis has tentacles that reach deep into Beaver County communities](https://www.timesonline.com/news/20180107/making-living-off-of-selling-death-from-dealers-to-addicts-opioid-crisis-has-tentacles-that-reach-deep-into-beaver-county-communities)

**Clarity and accuracy**
1. Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.
    * 5
1. What was it?
    * The opiod crisis has a large impact on Beaver County
1. Was it in the headline?
    * Yes
1. If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent
    * 4
1. Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization?
    * Hovering over the bars for actual numbers
1. Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?
    * The chart is small and hard to read, increasing the size would make it easier to navigate
1. Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
    * 3.5/4
1. List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
    * There isn't a source on the chart
1. List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.
    * Check with the Beaver County and Pennsylvania Health Departments
1. Did they provide a source?
    * No
1. Did they explain everything that needed explaining?
    * Yes
    
**Quality**
1. Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
    * 3
1. Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.
    * The size is small, but if the chart were larger it'd be easy to read. The bar colors for 2012, 2014 and 2016 are so similar that they almost look identical, which could be confusing to some users, especially those with visual impairments. Most importantly, there's no source, so no way for us to know if the data could be accurate
    
**Type and color (if piece includes graphics)**
1. Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose? 
    * For example, did it:
      * Look like it all belonged together?
        * Yes
      * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
        * Yes
      * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
        * No, some of the colors are too similar, which may confuse users
1. Type (1-5)
    * Explain
      * 4, San-serfif font is clear to read, but font size is a bit small and for some reason the drug types at the bottom are cut off (thought this could be a screen resolution thing on my end)
1. Color (1-5)
    * Explain
      * 3, Some of the colors are high contrast and distinct, but the colors for 2012, 2014 and 2016 are too similar
      
**Creativity**
1. Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
    * How?
      * The graph is at the very bottom of the story, I feel like it may have a bigger impact if it were higher up, perhaps after the first section
    * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.
      * 3, I personally don't have trouble reading this graph, but the colors may confuse some, and without a source there's no way to validate the data, making the chart pretty much useless.

**Pitch**

West Virginia, which historically has had terrible access to healthcare for residents in rural areas, is currently #1 in administering COVID-19 vaccines across the country. I want to know how a state with such poor access to healthcare is doing this. Data should be available from the West Virginia Department of Health and perhaps West Virginia University Medicine. I used to work for WVU Medicine, and WV's COVID-19 czar, who was appointed by the governor, is Clay Marsh, my former boss. I also worked in comms for WVU's School of Medicine, and know who to contact to set up an interview.
